/**
 * @file resume.h
 * @brief System-resume detector for the Wayland frontend
 *
 * The composition lifecycle's most user-visible failure mode is a stuck
 * modifier or runaway repeat after the laptop wakes up: while suspended
 * the kernel cannot deliver a key-up, and on resume the compositor may
 * not always emit a clean deactivate/activate round-trip. The lifecycle
 * therefore needs its own first-class "the system just resumed"
 * notification independent of @c zwp_input_method_v2 events.
 *
 * This module exposes two complementary detectors that converge on the
 * same single callback:
 *
 *  1. @b logind @c PrepareForSleep — system-bus signal emitted by
 *     systemd-logind around any suspend/hibernate transition. Reliable
 *     when present, but absent on non-systemd distros and on minimal
 *     containers. Only built when libdbus is available
 *     (@c HAVE_STATUS_BUS, since that already pulls in the dependency).
 *
 *  2. @b boottime/monotonic-gap heuristic — @c CLOCK_BOOTTIME advances
 *     during suspend while @c CLOCK_MONOTONIC does not. The event loop
 *     calls @c typio_wl_resume_signal_tick once per iteration; any gap
 *     greater than @c TYPIO_WL_RESUME_GAP_THRESHOLD_MS is treated as
 *     "the kernel just woke us up." Always built, so it serves as a
 *     fallback when logind is missing or its signal is lost.
 *
 * Both sources de-duplicate on a short cooldown window so a coincident
 * logind notification and detected gap fire the resume handler only
 * once.
