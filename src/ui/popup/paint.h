 * @brief Record the candidate panel into a flux canvas.
 *
 * The popup is drawn entirely on the GPU via flux: the background is the
 * canvas clear colour, rectangles (border, selection highlight, mode
 * divider) are solid fills, and text is filled glyph outlines. The popup
 * coordinator owns the frame lifecycle (begin_frame / submit / present);
 * this module only records draw commands between flux_canvas_begin/end.
